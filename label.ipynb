Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis. \\n\\n[1] First, I think I should find r. I recall the formula for r is the square root of (x squared plus y squared). Since the given point is (0, 3), that means x is 0 and y is 3. So plugging those into the formula, r should be sqrt(0^2 + 3^2). Let me compute that: 0 squared is 0, 3 squared is 9, so 0 + 9 is 9. The square root of 9 is 3. So r is 3. That seems straightforward.\\n\\n[2] Now, onto θ. I remember that θ is the angle from the positive x-axis to the point. Since the point is (0, 3), it's located on the positive y-axis, right? So in the rectangular coordinate system, that would correspond to an angle of π/2 radians. Let me confirm that. In the unit circle, 0 radians is along the positive x-axis, π/2 is straight up along the positive y-axis, π is to the left along the negative x-axis, and 3π/2 is straight down along the negative y-axis. So yes, (0, 3) is at π/2.\\n\\n[3] Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Sometimes, when dealing with negative r or angles, we have to consider the direction. But in this case, since r is positive, we don't have to worry about negative r. Also, since x is 0 and y is positive, it's in the first quadrant, which aligns with θ being π/2. \\n\\n[4] Is there another way to think about this? Maybe using trigonometry. The coordinates (0, 3) can be thought of as the point on the y-axis, 3 units above the origin. So in terms of polar coordinates, the radius is the length from the origin to that point, which we've already calculated as 3. The angle θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis, which is 90 degrees or π/2 radians. \\n\\n[5] Wait, let me visualize this. If I plot the point (0, 3) on a coordinate plane, it's directly above the origin. So, if I draw a line from the origin to that point, it forms a right angle with the x-axis. That angle is π/2, which is 90 degrees. \\n\\n[6] Is there any other angle that would also correspond to this point? Well, if I consider angles beyond π/2, like 3π/2, that would be pointing directly downward, which is (0, -3). But since our point is (0, 3), which is upwards, θ can't be 3π/2. So, π/2 is the correct angle.\\n\\n[7] Let me double-check my steps. First, I found r by using the Pythagorean theorem: sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = sqrt(0 + 9) = 3. That seems right. Then, for θ, since x is 0, that means the point is on the y-axis. So, the angle is either π/2 or 3π/2. But since the y-coordinate is positive, it's π/2. \\n\\n[8] I wonder if there's a formula for θ when x is 0. Maybe θ = arctan(y/x), but if x is 0, that would be arctan(infinity), which is undefined. So, in such cases, we have to know the position relative to the axes. Since x is 0 and y is positive, it's on the positive y-axis, so θ is π/2.\\n\\n[9] Alternatively, using the arctangent function might lead to an undefined result, but in this case, we can determine θ based on the quadrant. Since the point is on the positive y-axis, it's in the first quadrant (if we consider the positive x-axis as 0 radians). Wait, actually, in standard position, 0 radians is along the positive x-axis, and angles increase counterclockwise. So, the positive y-axis is π/2 radians.\\n\\n[10] Wait, to make sure, let me recall the unit circle. At 0 radians, it's (1, 0); at π/2, it's (0, 1); at π, it's (-1, 0); and at 3π/2, it's (0, -1). So, yes, (0, 3) is at π/2. \\n\\n[11] Another thought: if we consider the point (0, 3) in polar coordinates, it's at a distance of 3 from the origin, and the angle is π/2. So, r = 3, θ = π/2. \\n\\n[12] Is there a chance that I might have messed up the angle? For example, if x were negative or something, we'd have to adjust θ accordingly, but in this case, x is 0 and y is positive, so no issue.\\n\\n[13] Wait, just to think about another point: if the point was (0, -3), then θ would be 3π/2. But since it's (0, 3), θ is π/2. So, that makes sense.\\n\\n[14] Is there a way to represent this angle in a different range? Well, θ is given as 0 ≤ θ < 2π, so π/2 is within that range, so that's fine.\\n\\n[15] Let me also think about how to graph this in my mind. If I draw a circle with radius 3, the point (0, 3) would be at the top of the circle. So, that's 90 degrees from the x-axis. So, the angle is π/2. So, yeah, that seems correct.\\n\\n[16] I think I'm confident that r is 3 and θ is π/2. So, putting it all together, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2).\\n\\n[17] **Final Answer**\\nThe polar coordinates are \\\\boxed{(3, \\\\dfrac{\\\\pi}{2})}.\\n</STEPS>\\n<ideal_output>\\n{\\n\\\"verification_steps\\\": [3, 7, 10],\\n\\\"conclusion_steps\\\": [16]\\n}\\n</ideal_output>\\n</example>\\n</examples>\\n\\n\"\n",
